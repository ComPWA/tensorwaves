"""A model optimization package for Partial Wave Analysis.

The `tensorwaves` package contains four main ingredients:

  Function creation (`tensorwaves.function`)
    Express arbitrary mathematical expressions as functions in different kinds of
    computational backends, such as :doc:`JAX <jax:index>`, `TensorFlow
    <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_, `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_, and `Numba
    <https://numba.pydata.org>`_.

  Data generation (`tensorwaves.data`)
    Generate phase space samples as well as hit-and-miss Monte Carlo samples for the
    input mathematical expression.

  Optimization (`tensorwaves.optimizer` and `.estimator`)
    Optimize a `.ParametrizedFunction` with respect to some data sample and an
    `.Estimator` (loss function).

The `.interface` module defines how the main classes interact.
