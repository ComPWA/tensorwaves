TensorWaves is a fitter package that optimizes mathematical models to data
samples. The models can be any mathematical expression that is then converted
to any computational backend. In addition, TensorWaves provides functionality
to generate toy Monte Carlo data samples.

All documentation can be found on
[tensorwaves.rtfd.io](https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/tensorwaves).

For an overview of **upcoming releases and planned functionality**, see
