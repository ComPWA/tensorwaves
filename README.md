TensorWaves is a fitter package that optimizes mathematical models to data
samples. The models can be any _symbolic_ mathematical expression that is then
converted to any computational backend. In addition, TensorWaves provides
functionality to generate toy Monte Carlo data samples. The package is
developed in parallel with [AmpForm](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform), which
implements physics models, but its 'lambdifying' mechanisms can in principle be
used independently.

All documentation can be found on
[tensorwaves.rtfd.io](https://tensorwaves.readthedocs.io).
