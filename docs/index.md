:::{margin}

TensorWaves originates from [`pycompwa`](https://compwa.github.io), which did
its computations through a function tree that is similar to
[TensorFlow graphs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/graphs) and
[SymPy expression trees](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/manipulation.html).
The decision to use Python only has been further inspired by
[TensorFlowAnalysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/poluekt/TensorFlowAnalysis),
[AmpliTF](https://github.com/apoluekt/AmpliTF) and
[zfit](https://github.com/zfit/zfit).

:::

TensorWaves is an optimizer package that can 'fit' mathematical models
(expressed with {mod}`sympy`) to data distributions using a variety of
computational back-ends, optimizers, and estimator functions. In addition, the
{mod}`tensorwaves.data` module helps one to generate data distributions for
those mathematical expressions.

The package is developed in parallel with {doc}`AmpForm <ampform:index>`, which
implements physics models for amplitude analysis, but its mechanisms for
creating computational backend functions can in principle be used
independently.
