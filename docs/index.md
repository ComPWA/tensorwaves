TensorWaves originates from [`pycompwa`](https://compwa.github.io), which did its
computations through a function tree that is similar to
[TensorFlow graphs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/graphs) and
[SymPy expression trees](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/manipulation.html). The
decision to use Python only has been further inspired by
[TensorFlowAnalysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/poluekt/TensorFlowAnalysis),
[AmpliTF](https://github.com/apoluekt/AmpliTF) and [zfit](https://github.com/zfit/zfit).

:::

TensorWaves is an optimizer package that can 'fit' mathematical models (expressed with
{mod}`sympy`) to data distributions using a variety of computational back-ends,
optimizers, and estimator functions. In addition, the {mod}`tensorwaves.data` module
helps one to generate data distributions for those mathematical expressions.

The package is developed in parallel with {doc}`AmpForm <ampform:index>`, which
implements physics models for amplitude analysis, but its mechanisms for creating
computational backend functions can in principle be used independently.
