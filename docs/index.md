TensorWaves is a fitter package that optimizes mathematical models to data
samples. The models can be any mathematical expression (best expressed with
{mod}`sympy`) that is then converted to any computational backend. In addition,
the {mod}`tensorwaves.data` module allows one to generate toy data samples.

The package originates from {mod}`pycompwa`, which did its computations through
[ComPWA](https://github.com/ComPWA/ComPWA). ComPWA's function tree is similar
to for instance
[TensorFlow graphs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/graphs) and
[SymPy expression trees](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/manipulation.html).
The decision to use Python only has been further inspired by
[TensorFlowAnalysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/poluekt/TensorFlowAnalysis)/[AmpliTF](https://github.com/apoluekt/AmpliTF)
and [zfit](https://github.com/zfit/zfit).
