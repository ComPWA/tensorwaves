TensorWaves is a Python package for doing Partial Wave Analysis with
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) as computational backend. The package
originates from [pycompwa](pycompwa), which did its computations through
[ComPWA](https://github.com/ComPWA/ComPWA) â€” ComPWA's function tree is similar
to TensorFlow graphs and can therefore be replaced by the tools that TensorFlow
already offers. The decision to completely migrate ComPWA to TensorFlow has
been further inspired by
[TensorFlowAnalysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/poluekt/TensorFlowAnalysis)/[AmpliTF](https://github.com/apoluekt/AmpliTF)
and [zfit](https://github.com/zfit/zfit)
